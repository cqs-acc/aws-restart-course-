## **Real order of SQL execution (logical order)**

When you run a query like:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM city
WHERE population > 500000
ORDER BY city_name;
```
SQL doesn't start with the `SELECT`. 
It actually processes the clauses in this logical order: 


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Step</th>
    <th>Clause</th>
    <th>What happens</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>FROM</td>
    <td>SQL starts by locating and loading the table(s) â€” here, it fetches data from city.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>WHERE</td>
    <td>It filters the rows that meet the condition (e.g., only cities with population &gt; 500000).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>GROUP BY (if present)</td>
    <td>SQL groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>HAVING (if present)</td>
    <td>It filters the groups formed in the previous step.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>SELECT</td>
    <td>Only now does SQL pick the columns (or expressions) you asked for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>ORDER BY</td>
    <td>Finally, it sorts the result set in the requested order.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>LIMIT / OFFSET (if present)</td>
    <td>SQL may restrict the number of rows returned.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

***Given another example below***:

```sql
SELECT * FROM city;
```

Here's what happens internally:
 1. **FROM city** ==> SQL locates the `city` table and loads all rows into memory. 
 2. **SELECT `*`** ==> It then selects all columns from the table ( `*` means every column).
 3. **Result displayed** ==> The final output is shown to you. 

 **Very important:**
 Althouh we *write* `SELECT` first, SQL *executes* `FROM` first - because SQL must know **where** the data is coming from before it can **select** anything!
